		script = "Spanish Landscape with Mountains demonstrates Carrington’s fascination "
				+ "with the Andalusian landscape which she visited during her travels "
				+ "throughout France and Spain in the 1920s. The steep, rolling mountains in "
				+ "the foreground of this painting contrast with the jagged peaks in the "
				+ "background, and the impression is of a distant territory, both unfamiliar "
				+ "and alien. Carrington responds to the Andalusian landscape with vibrant "
				+ "oranges and yellows. The enormous scale of the mountains is emphasised "
				+ "by the inclusion of four mules and their muleteers which are just visible "
				+ "along a narrow path, and the warm climate is evident from the cacti which "
				+ "grows in the otherwise barren landscape. Carrington exploits the sense of "
				+ "isolation in this forbidding terrain.Carrington made studies for this "
				+ "painting at Yegen, a town 4000 feet above sea level in Southern Spain "
				+ "which offered spectacular views of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. She "
				+ "wrote to the friend of her husband Ralph Partridge, Gerald Brenan, who was "
				+ "then living in Yegen. She completed this work when she returned to her home "
				+ "at Tidmarsh Mill near Pangbourne, and referred to it again in a letter to "
				+ "Brenan. The painting was given to Tate by the Bloomsbury writer, Frances "
				+ "Partridge, who in 1933 married Carrington’s former husband, Ralph Partridge, "
				+ "following her early death from suicide.";
