				+ "sources could re-invigorate post-war culture. In the same year "
				+ "Appel also used the title Questioning Children for a controversial "
				+ "mural at the Town Hall in Amsterdam, which was condemned as "
				+ "incomprehensible, and covered over with wallpaper. There is a "
				+ "note of tragedy in these works as the Dutch title also means "
				+ "\'begging children\' and evokes scenes of poverty that Appel had "
				+ "witnessed in post-war Germany. The childlike colours and style "
				+ "of this intrigued me. ";
